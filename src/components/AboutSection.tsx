              I am Louay Khemiri, a game programmer and Computer Engineering student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology in Poland. I have been involved in the game development field since the start of my academic career through four internships with different game studios.
              I have practical experience in designing and implementing game mechanics and serious games especially during my internship at Orange Tunisia where I worked on simulations that replicate real-world tasks and environments. My most significant professional experience was at DM Nova, an educational technology startup. I created an educational video game for children which combines entertainment with educational content.



            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90">
              I have also developed several independent game projects which 
              demonstrate my creative abilities and technical expertise.
               Some of these projects are complex and may not have online demos, 
               but they are fully functional and can be run locally.

             You can check out my work by visiting my GitHub page for all my projects and my website for more information.
              Enjoy the journey through my creations!
